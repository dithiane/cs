How does each function “scale”? 
Which of the two functions scales better? 
How can you tell?

The bigger the array, the bigger the difference. 
Push() is faster.
Unshift() must shift all the elements that are already in the array, 
Push() must insert an element at the end of the array, so none of the indexes of the array elements must change.

The push methods are fast, but the unshift method is slow, because
work with the end of the array is faster than with its beginning. 
Just taking and removing element number 0 is not enough. 
You also need to re-number the rest of the elements.
